  <h1>DappList - THIS WEBSITE IS NOT YET FINISHED</h1>
  <p>DappList is a dapp (decentralised application) that exists on the Ethereum virtual machine. Its function is to store a list of other dapps. It is free to add an entry (advertisement) to the list. Once added, it cannot be removed by anyone, and can only be modified by the account that added it. I have no more control over the list than you do! If you give a donation, it will make me happy and might motivate me to improve this revolting website. It will also make your ad appear higher on the default sorting order.</p>
  
  <p>The benefit of having this list on Ethereum is that it's controlled by nobody, and relies on nobody. If you want, you can download this web page and you'll still be able to use DappList when this page is no longer hosted. I can't censor the list, and nor can anyone else.</p>
  
  <p>If you can't put up with my "web design," you can <a href="https://github.com/b1n4ry7r33/DappList">fork my website</a> if you want. It's under GNU General Public License 3.0, so please provide the same freedom in any forks you create.</p>
